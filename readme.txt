Replace your stock wordpress gallery with our Slider. Also show your gallery on any page or post with our shortcode. Requires BePro Listings.

== Description ==

This is a Free addon for BePro Listings. It is used to replace the stock wordpress gallery for pages generated by BePro Listings. It uses the [bxSlider jQuery plugin](http://bxslider.com/) so you can expect a responsive (mobile friendly) experience.

= WHAT YOU GET =

This addon has a premium version with many more features. However, in this version we provide the following features

	1. Admin area for managing options
	2. Slider option in admin
	3. 3 new listing templates (bpg1, bpg2, and bpg3)

Collectively, this allows you transform your listings experience into one thats more image and gallery focued.

= HOW IT WORKS =

Management controls for the **gallery** **slider** features can be found in the addon admin menu for BePro Listings. There you need to select the "slider1" option. All uses of the wordpress gallery shortcode "[gallery]" on your website, will now be run from our slider. This includes BePro Listings pages, if you are using them.

With our Gallery Slider addon, you can also use a shortcode to show the gallery on any page or post. Simply assign the "blpid" shortcode option with the "page ID" where the images are attached 

[bpg_slider blpid="123"]

This is a great way to make your gallery attractive, on listing pages and throughout your website. This jquery gallery is especially useful for those whose websites are responsive since the slider will automatically resize with your theme.

= UPGRADES =

Note that there is an **Pro Version** of this plugin with 5 slider options. It also has many more shortcode options allowing you to show photos from entire categories of posts or a set of specific posts. A great example of what can be done, especially with custom BePro Listings templates, can be seen on our $1 wordpress theme
